## 1. Notes

    This is the implementation of "Combining computer vision with fuzzy logic for real-time detection of personal protective equipment non-use"
    The repo is still under development. Comprehensive system details and its evaluation will be provided as soon as the article is published.

## 2. Environment

    pytorch>=1.7.0, python>=3.6, Ubuntu/Windows, see more in 'requirements.txt'
    
## 3. Model Zoo

The YOLOX object detector and EfficientNet image classfier models can be accessed or downloaded 
from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12JIuHlAcgz9kY_DWUv-mNlsUljSMmexW?usp=sharing) .
